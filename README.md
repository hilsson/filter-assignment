# FilterAssignment

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.3.3.
This is an assigment for a recruitement process. It represents an analytics filter functionality.

## Remarks

A few unit tests are showcased in `event-container.component.spec.ts`.
Not all functionality is complete, e.g. form validation, error and edge case handling at least is missing.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```
